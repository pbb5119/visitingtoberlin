<p> Brandenburg Gate was constructed in 1971, designed by Carl Gotthard who was architect to the Prussian court. It symbolized the history of Europe and Germany. Using this gate, Nazis marched through this gate to show Hitler rise to power. Even a lot of infrastructure was destroyed in Berlin during World War II. However, Brandenburg Gate survived World war II with minimum damage. After the restoration and Berlin wall was built, access to east germany was cut off.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The Holocaust Memorial is a memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe. The memorial consists of two thousand, seven hundred and eleven Gray slabs, which are identical in shape. Those exhibits represent the hostility, treatment and killing of European Jews.<sup>2</sup><p>

<p>Charlottenburg Palace is the largest residence of the Hohenzollern, German former royal dynasty, in Berlin. It was built by Elector Frederick III, German Emperor and King of Prussia, for his wife Schloss Charlottenburg for a summer residence. The palace is surrounded by a baroque garden and stunning examples of baroque architecture. This palace holds one of the largest French paintings of the 18th century outside of French.<sup>3</sup><p>

<p>The East Side Gallery is one of the most popular sites in Berlin. After the fall of the Wall, artists have turned it into the largest gallery consisting of a series of murals painted directly on a 1,316 m Berlin Wall. Painting on the wall represents freedom of expression and the end of an oppressive era. The painting consists of a political statement, fraternal kiss, bridge, etc.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Berlin Cathedral is one of the most decorative cathedrals in Berlin from the 15th century. It was originally part of the city palace, residence of the House of Hohenzollern from 1443 to 1918. When Wilhelm II came to the throne as Emperor of Germany in 1888, Julius Carl Raschdorff was commissioned to design a new church before the previous church was demolished. During World II, the church was severely damaged. Later, it was renovated.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>The building was constructed during Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor, and King of Prussia ruling period. Initially, it housed an imperial assembly. In 1933, Hitler seized the building and was destroyed by fire. During World II, it was further destroyed by Russian troops. After that, Reichstag was renovated. Now, it serves as the Federal Assembly of the lower house of Germanyâ€™s legislature. <sup>6</sup></p>
